# InventApp Architecture

## System Overview
InventApp is built on a serverless architecture using n8n as the workflow automation platform. The system integrates multiple services to provide a seamless inventory management experience.

## Core Components

### 1. Telegram Integration
- Handles user input through messages and voice commands
- Provides real-time notifications and responses
- Supports both text and voice-based interactions

### 2. Database Layer (Supabase)
- Stores product information
- Manages inventory data
- Handles CRUD operations
- Provides real-time updates

### 3. AI Processing Layer
- Interprets user commands
- Processes natural language
- Handles voice-to-text conversion
- Provides intelligent responses

### 4. Notification System
- Sends alerts for expiring products
- Provides daily inventory updates
- Manages user notifications

## Data Flow
1. User sends command via Telegram
2. System processes input (text or voice)
3. AI interprets the command
4. Database operations are performed
5. Response is sent back to user

## Security Considerations
- API keys and credentials are managed through n8n credentials
- Database access is restricted
- Webhook URLs are secured
- User authentication is handled through Telegram

## Scalability
The system is designed to be scalable through:
- Serverless architecture
- Database optimization
- Caching mechanisms
- Load balancing

## Monitoring and Maintenance
- Error logging
- Performance tracking
- Regular backups
- System health checks
